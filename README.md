ICLR 2021 Deep Learning for Simulation workshop paper: "Online parameter inference for the simulation of a Bunsen flame using heteroscedastic Bayesian neural network ensembles".

# Summary
The paper applies a Bayesian neural network ensemble method for regression of parameters of a flame edge model. The ensemble is trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real experiments of a Bunsen flame.

# Basic usage
To train a single neural network
- python main.py (default: seed = 0, start epoch = 0, models saved to directory 'output_0')
- python main.py -s 1 (seed the training process with seed = 1, models saved to 'output_1') 
- python main.py -s 1 -c 1000 (start the training process from model pre-saved at epoch = 1000)

A neural network with seed = 1 pre-trained for 1000 epochs is provided in 'output_1'.

# Ensemble training
- An ensemble can be trained by uniquely seeding each member of the ensemble and running 'python main.py -s (seed)'

# Requirements
- python 3.6.8
- pytorch 1.6.0
